This is the development repository for DLTdv and friends. 

See http://www.unc.edu/~thedrick/software1.html for stable versions, sample data and so on.

Current development by Ty Hedrick is focused on DLTdv6, which works on the latest versions of MATLAB,
introduces a "sparse" data file format which only stores the not-NaN data and has an option for only
updating the active movie, greatly reducing display latency for projects with several compressed video
files.  DLTdv6 currently DOES NOT have a multi-track option, so if you're using that stick with DLTdv5 
for now.
